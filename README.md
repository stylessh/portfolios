# Stylessh

This is the source code of my portfolio's frontend.

### Don't be aware to take a look into it!

## Enviroment

This website is using Next.js as frontend framework. And some awesome animations libraries (such as Framer Motion, GSAP).


## Installation

- First of all, you have to clone this repo.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/stylessh/portfolios.git
```

- Then, get inside in the folder and install all the packages with:

```bash
yarn install
```

> If you don't have *yarn* installed, enter the following command: `npm i yarn -g`

- And now, you just have to run `next dev` to start a development server of my website.
